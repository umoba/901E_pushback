Created config.cpp and config.hpp that allows software information, such as constants, bools, and other variables that are used globally all throughout the project. 

Updated the intake file based on Config.prematches.skillsMode, where the bool determines whether the mode is skills, and then decreases the outtake of the upper goal based on the bool value.
